    <h1>Instructions for Moving Photos from Your Android Phone to Your PC</h1>

    <p>
        Hi dad!  Here are the instructions I was able to put together for moving your photos.  Let me know if you end up needing some help.  I'm not sure how easy this will be to follow.
    </p>
    <p>Also, a note.  I tried to always type "left click" and "right click."  But, if I ended up typing just "click," then I mean "left click."  Also, when I type "double click," I always mean to do the double-click with the left click.</p>

    <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Phone</li>
        <li>Laptop</li>
        <li>USB Cable - Whichever one you use for your phone.  It should have the small end that fits in your phone and the larger end that fits in the laptop's USB port:</li>
        <br>

    </ul>

    <h3>HERE WE GO!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Turn your laptop on and let it get fully booted up.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn on your phone and, same thing, let it fully boot up.</p></li>
        <li><p>Plug in your phone to the laptop.  You can do the phone end or the laptop end first.  The order shouldn't matter.</p></li>
        <li><p>Before you do anything on your laptop, you need to pick a specific setting on your phone.</p></li>
        <li><p>The settings you have to choose from should pop up on your phone when you plug it in.  If they don't, you need to drag down from the top of your phone to show the alerts section (where it shows that you may have gotten a new email or text message, those alerts.)  Amongst your alerts  there should be an option that says something along the lines of "Android System - Charging this device via USB - Tap for more options."  Click that bad boy with your finger to bring up the options.  They will look something like this:</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/choices.png" alt="" id="choices">
        <li><p>Of these choices, the one you want to pick is Transfer Files (or "File Transfer" or something like that.)  Not Transfer Photos!  So, choose Transfer Files with your finger, like you normally do with your phone.</p></li>
        <li><p>Then, set down your phone, you won't need to touch it anymore.  (But do keep it plugged into your laptop!)</p></li>
        <li><p>Now, we go to your laptop.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/1.png" alt="" id="1" class="pic">
        <li><p>We start on your desktop, with no folders or windows open, as per the above picture.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/23.png" alt="" id="23" class="pic">
        <li><p>Go down to your taskbar, at the bottom of your overall laptop window.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/2.png" alt="" id="2" class="pic">
        <li><p>Right click on the folder icon.  Doing so will open the menu you see above.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/3.png" alt="" id="3" class="pic">
        <li><p>Left click the item that says "File Explorer."</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/24.png" alt="" class="pic" id="24">
        <li><p>Before we look at what's in this folder/window, we want to make sure the window is maximized.  Maximized means it takes up the entire space of the Laptop's window, except for the Taskbar, at the bottom.  In order to maximize the window, left click the square-shaped button that is being pointed to, above.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/22.png" alt="" id="22" class="pic">
        <li><p>So, this is the maximized window that we got when we left clicked the "File Explorer" words, back in step 12.  It should show some collection of those Folders at the top of the window, with the Local Disk and Phone icons below the folders, under the heading of "Devices and drives".</p>
        <p>If it doesn't show this window with these icons, go onto step 15.  If it does show this window with these icons, you can skip to step 19.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/18.png" alt="" id="18" class="pic">
        <li><p>What we want to open up is what's called the 'Navigation Pane.'  It's the list on the far left of the picture above.  (From what we've discussed before, you do already have this open.  So, the next couple of steps may be moot.)  If this list is already up, skip to step 18.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/19.png" alt="" id="19" class="pic">
        <li><p>So, if the 'Navigation Pane' isn't there, left click the 'View' word, up at the top of your window, pointed to above.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/20.png" alt="" id="20" class="pic">
        <li><p>Left clicking the 'View' button will drop down the "ribbon" that you see above, directly below the 'File,' 'Computer,' and 'View' words.  On this "ribbon," left click the icon that says 'Navigation Pane.'  And I mean, specifically, the blue and white icon, not the words underneath the icon that say "Navigation Pane".</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/21.png" alt="" id="21" class="pic">
        <li><p>Left clicking this icon should make the 'Navigation Pane' appear on the far left of your window.  (The one that says "Quick Access" at the top.)  Within the list inside the 'Navigation Pane,' you need to left click the words that say 'This PC'.  There's a chance it may say something else, but it will still be the words that are to the right of the icon that looks like a computer monitor.</p>
        <p>Left clicking those words should change the window on the right to the window we want.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/4.png" alt="" id="4" class="pic">
        <li><p>Find your phone amongst the icons under 'Devices and Drives.'  It won't say "moto g stylus 5G' as it does in the picture above.  But, it should show the Phone-Like icon and it will say whatever type of phone you have to the right of the icon.  Double-click this icon to open your phone.</p>
        </li>        
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/5.png" alt="" id="5" class="pic">
        <li><p>Once your phone has been opened, the window should look something like the above.  If you have an SD storage card that you physically put into your phone, then you will see the right-most icon, that will say SD Card.  If you don't, it won't be there.</p>
        <p>BUT!  We don't care about the SD Card icon.  The only icon we care about should say something like "Internal shared storage."  Like the one we're pointing to above.  Double-click it to open it.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/6.png" alt="" id="6" class="pic">
        <li><p>Once you've opened the Internal Shared Storage, you should see a bunch of folders, like the above.  The only folder we care about is the 'DCIM' folder.  There is a folder that says 'Pictures,' but we don't care about that folder, at all.  It just holds the pictures that you may have downloaded from any websites you visited with your phone.</p>
        <p>Double-click the 'DCIM' folder to open it.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/7.png" alt="" id="7" class="pic">
        <li><p>Once you open the 'DCIM' folder, you should be shown the window above, which only holds the 'Camera' folder.  If there are any other folders in here, that's weird, and you should ignore them. :)</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/8.png" alt="" id="8" class="pic">
        <li><p>Once you've opened the 'Camera' folder, you should see all of your photos.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/9.png" alt="" id="9" class="pic">
        <li><p>Now, we want to resize the window that we just entered, that is holding all your phone's photos.  We want it smaller than the Laptop's overall window.  So we can see the Desktop, again.  Like the above.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/25.png" alt="" id="25" class="pic">
        <li><p>In order to do so, left click the button that is being pointed to above.  (It's essentially the same button we clicked to maximize the window, in the first place.  It just looks slightly different and does the opposite of maximize, which is minimize.)</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/10.png" alt="" id="10" class="pic">
        <li><p>Now, if you already have a folder picked out that you want to move your photos to, open it up and move to the 2nd paragraph in step 29.  If you don't, do this step 26 through step 28, where we create a new folder on your destop.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/11.png" alt="" id="11" class="pic">
        <li><p>Right click within the desktop area to bring up the menu, above.  On the first menu, left click the word "New".  It will open up the second menu, where we will left click on "Folder".  Doing this will create a new folder on your desktop.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/12.png" alt="" id="12" class="pic">
        <li><p>You can see the new folder on the desktop, above.  While the words below it are highlighted in blue, you can rename the folder to whatever you want.  Once you have it named how you like, just hit the 'Enter' button, and it will keep the name.  (I'm just going to leave it as "New Folder."  Also, if you accidentally leave it as "New Folder," don't worry, it's easily changeable later.  Just call me and we can walk through it.)</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/13.png" alt="" id="13" class="pic">
        <li><p>Double-click the new folder that we just created, in order to open it up.  It should open up in its minimized format, as above.  If not, and it opens in its maximized format, refer back to step 25 and do the same thing we did there in order to minimize the photos folder.</p>
        <p>Now, we just want the folders next to each other.  They don't have to be exactly as above.  But we're now going to drag and drop from one to the other, so we need to be able to see both and be able to reach both with the mouse cursor.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/14.png" alt="" id="14" class="pic">
        <li><p>Now, we're going to select the photos from your phone.  Left click somewhere in the folder, as shown above.  It can even be on one of the photos.  It doesn't truly matter.  We're just selecting that folder when we left click in it.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/15.png" alt="" id="15" class="pic">
        <li><p>Once that folder has been clicked in and selected, you need to type the Control Key plus the A Key.  So, click the Control Key first (it probably just says "Ctrl" on it, and it is situation on the bottom row of your keyboard, toward the left.) and then click the A Key as you're still holding the Control Key.  Then, let go of both.  (Letting go of both doesn't have to happen at the exact same time.  But, don't let go of the Control button first.  If you don't release at the same time, release the A button first and then the Control button.)</p>
        <p>As we go to move the photos, you may lose the selection of all of the photos.  You'll be able to tell because they won't all show that gray color around them, as you can see above.  If that happens (it will happen if you click outside of the folder or somewhere inside it,) just do step 30 and the previous part of this step 31 again.</p>
        </li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/16.png" alt="" id="16" class="pic">
        <li><p>Now, in order to grab ahold of the selected photos, you need to left click and hold down the left click.  (If you don't hold it down until we want to let it go, you may drop the pictures somewhere else.  Now, that somewhere else may be onto the Desktop.  So, not really terribly far from where we wanted to get them.  But still, not exactly where we're aiming!)  Then, while still holding down the left click, drag the photos over to the new folder we created on your Laptop.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/17.png" alt="" id="17" class="pic">
        <li><p>Holding and dragging the photos should look like the above.  Once it does, let go of the left click you've been holding.  This will "drop" them in the Laptop's folder.</p></li>
        <img src="./Picture Transfer Instructions_files/26.png" alt="" id="26" class="pic">
        <li><p>I assume you'll be moving over a bunch of photos.  If so, there should be a small window that pops up and says "Copying..." at the top left.  Like the picture above shows.  (And, if you're not moving many pictures, that window may never pop up.  But, it most likely will.)  Once that window closes, your photos have been moved successfully!</p></li>
